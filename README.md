# armada
An open-source jailbreaking tool for multiple iOS devices and versions.

Mostly just a fork of [Jailbreak Me 13.37](https://github.com/MTJailed/jailbreakme) and [Spawn5](https://github.com/BlekShader/spawn5) that I've decided to finish and add more functionality to since those projects are now defunct. Support will continue until development has completed, and maybe even beyond.

I'll most likely accept any pull requests so long as they don't break anything.
